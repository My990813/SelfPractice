# Study notes

#Image Classification —— Identifying a Cake’s Flavor

Object Detection —— Finding All Decorations on a Cake

Semantic Segmentation —— Coloring Different Parts of a Cake to Distinguish Them

Instance Segmentation —— Distinguishing Every Single Strawberry on a Cake

#Traditional CV (e.g., SIFT/HOG Features + SVM Classifier) —— Handmade Simple Cake Molds

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) —— You own a set of intelligent molds that can automatically adjust their shape. It adapts to any cake style you want (e.g., circular, square, heart-shaped, even creative designs) without requiring manual mold changes.

Transfer Learning —— You have a ready-made vanilla cake recipe (pre-trained model). Instead of developing a new recipe from scratch, you only need to modify a few ingredients (e.g., add cocoa powder for chocolate cake, add matcha powder for matcha cake) to quickly create a new flavor.

Image Generation (e.g., GAN, VAE) —— creates a brand-new cake that has never been made before but meets the customer’s requirements based on their description, rather than replicating an existing style.

Image Super-Resolution —— You have a blurry photo of a cake. Through technical processing, the fine textures of the cake (e.g., cream lines, strawberry seeds) become clearly visible, as if the photo was taken up close.

Object Tracking —— You watch the entire cake-making process and keep your focus on one specific strawberry, accurately locating it no matter where it is moved.
