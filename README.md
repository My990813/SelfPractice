# Coding Practice

#Study note: Train Models to make prediction

#Traditional Machine Learning: Make the same cake according to a fixed recipe (predicting known outcomes)--make deterministic predictions based on the pattern fitting of existing data 

Linear Regression & Logistic Regression--Precisely predict the final outcome of a cake (e.g., sweetness, softness) based on ingredient quantities.

Decision Trees & Random Forests--Determine the cake-making plan or classification result step by step based on multiple conditions.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)--Judge the category or attributes of a new cake by comparing it to similar existing cakes.

Support Vector Machines (SVM)--Find an "optimal dividing line" to accurately separate different categories of cakes.

Clustering Algorithms (e.g., K-Means)--Automatically group similar cakes into clusters without pre-existing labels.


#VAE(Variational Autoencoder): Make new cakes according to flavor rules (generating new outcomes that fit the distribution)--Generative modeling based on probability distribution for probabilistic prediction and data generation
